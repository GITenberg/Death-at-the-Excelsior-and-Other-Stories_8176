description: Although P.G. Wodehouse is best known as a writer of humorous fiction,
  he also tried his hand at other genres, as well. The title story in this wide-ranging
  collection is a detective story, albeit one that is served up with a heaping dollop
  of the hilarity for which Wodehouse's work is acclaimed. This comprehensive collection
  of short pieces from Wodehouse is a perfect introduction to his unique style.
